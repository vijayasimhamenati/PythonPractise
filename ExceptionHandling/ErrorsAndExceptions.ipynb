The Three Categories of Errors\n","\n","In Python (and programming in general), errors are broadly classified into three categories based on *when* they happen and *how* they behave.\n","\n","1. **Syntax Errors:** (Compile-Time) grammar mistakes. The code won't run at all.\n","2. **Runtime Errors (Exceptions):** The code starts running but crashes midway due to an illegal operation.\n","3. **Logical Errors:** The code runs perfectly without crashing, but produces the **wrong result**.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 2. Syntax Errors (Parsing Errors)\n","\n","These are the most basic errors. They occur when you violate the \"grammar rules\" of Python.\n","\n","* **Behavior:** Python stops **before** executing a single line of code.\n","* **Common Causes:** Missing colons `:`, unmatched parentheses `()`, or invalid keywords.\n","\n","```python\n","# ERROR 1: Missing colon\n","# if True\n","#     print(\"Yes\")\n","# Output: SyntaxError: expected ':'\n","\n","# ERROR 2: Unmatched Parenthesis\n","# print(\"Hello World\"\n","# Output: SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing\n","\n","```\n","\n","**IndentationError:**\n","A specific type of Syntax Error unique to Python. It happens when your whitespace (tabs/spaces) is inconsistent.\n","\n","```python\n","def greet():\n","print(\"Hello\") # Error! Needs indentation.\n","# Output: IndentationError: expected an indented block\n","\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 3. Runtime Errors (Exceptions)\n","\n","These errors occur **during execution**. The syntax is correct, but Python encounters a situation it cannot handle (like dividing by zero or opening a missing file).\n","\n","When a runtime error occurs, Python raises an **Exception** and crashes (unless handled).\n","\n","#### A. `NameError`\n","\n","Trying to use a variable that hasn't been defined yet.\n","\n","```python\n","# print(age)\n","# Output: NameError: name 'age' is not defined\n","\n","```\n","\n","#### B. `TypeError`\n","\n","Applying an operation to an object of an inappropriate type.\n","\n","* *Example:* Adding a number to a string.\n","\n","```python\n","# x = \"10\" + 5\n","# Output: TypeError: can only concatenate str (not \"int\") to str\n","\n","```\n","\n","#### C. `ValueError`\n","\n","The type is correct, but the **value** is inappropriate.\n","\n","* *Example:* Trying to convert a non-numeric string to an integer.\n","\n","```python\n","# x = int(\"abc\")\n","# Output: ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'abc'\n","\n","```\n","\n","#### D. `IndexError`\n","\n","Trying to access an index that is out of range in a sequence (List/Tuple/String).\n","\n","```python\n","lst = [1, 2, 3]\n","# print(lst[10])\n","# Output: IndexError: list index out of range\n","\n","```\n","\n","#### E. `KeyError`\n","\n","Trying to access a key in a dictionary that does not exist.\n","\n","```python\n","data = {\"name\": \"Alice\"}\n","# print(data[\"age\"])\n","# Output: KeyError: 'age'\n","\n","```\n","\n","#### F. `ZeroDivisionError`\n","\n","Mathematical error when dividing by zero.\n","\n","```python\n","# x = 10 / 0\n","# Output: ZeroDivisionError: division by zero\n","\n","```\n","\n","#### G. `AttributeError`\n","\n","Trying to access an attribute or method that an object doesn't have.\n","\n","```python\n","text = \"Hello\"\n","# text.append(\"World\")\n","# Output: AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'append'\n","# (Strings are immutable; they don't have .append())\n","\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 4. Logical Errors (The Silent Killers)\n","\n","These are the hardest to debug because **Python does not complain**. The code runs successfully, but the logic is flawed.\n","\n","* **Behavior:** No crash, no error message, just incorrect data.\n","\n","**Example 1: Order of Operations**\n","\n","```python\n","# Goal: Calculate average of 10 and 20\n","a = 10\n","b = 20\n","\n","# WRONG LOGIC\n","average = a + b / 2\n","print(average)\n","# Output: 20.0 (Because division happens before addition!)\n","# Expected: 15.0\n","\n","# CORRECT LOGIC\n","average = (a + b) / 2\n","print(average) # 15.0\n","\n","```\n","\n","**Example 2: Infinite Loop**\n","A `while` loop that never updates its condition is a logical error (it freezes the program).\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 5. Reading a Traceback\n","\n","When Python crashes, it prints a \"Traceback\". Learning to read this is a superpower.\n","\n","**Structure of a Traceback:**\n","\n","1. **The File/Cell:** Tells you *where* the error happened (Cell number, Line number).\n","2. **The Code:** Shows the exact line of code that failed.\n","3. **The Error Type:** (at the very bottom) `ValueError`, `TypeError`, etc.\n","4. **The Message:** Describes *why* it failed.\n","\n","> **Tip:** Always read the **last line** of the traceback first. That tells you what actually went wrong."],"metadata":{"id":"__a3jEyDl7Wi"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### syntax
