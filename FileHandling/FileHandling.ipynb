Introduction to File Handling\n","\n","File handling is the process of storing data in a file or reading data from a file. Python makes this very easy with the built-in `open()` function.\n","\n","**The Key Concept:**\n","When you open a file, you are creating a **stream** (a connection) between your Python script and the file on your hard drive. You must always **close** this stream when you are done to prevent data corruption or memory leaks.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 2. Opening Files (`open()`)\n","\n","To work with a file, you first need to open it.\n","\n","* **Syntax:** `file_object = open(\"filename\", \"mode\")`\n","\n","**Common Modes:**\n","\n","* `'r'`: **Read** (Default). Opens for reading. Fails if file doesn't exist.\n","* `'w'`: **Write**. Opens for writing. **Creates** a new file or **Overwrites** an existing one (be careful!).\n","* `'a'`: **Append**. Opens for writing. Adds data to the **end** of the file. Creates file if it doesn't exist.\n","* `'x'`: **Create**. Creates a new file. Fails if file already exists.\n","* `'b'`: **Binary Mode** (e.g., `'rb'`, `'wb'`). Used for images, videos, etc.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 3. Reading from Files\n","\n","There are three main ways to read data.\n","\n","**A. `read()` - The Whole Thing**\n","Reads the entire file content into a single string.\n","\n","```python\n","file = open(\"example.txt\", \"r\")\n","content = file.read()\n","print(content)\n","file.close()\n","\n","```\n","\n","**B. `readline()` - Line by Line**\n","Reads a single line (up to the `\\n` character).\n","\n","```python\n","file = open(\"example.txt\", \"r\")\n","line1 = file.readline()\n","line2 = file.readline()\n","print(line1, end=\"\") # content of line 1\n","file.close()\n","\n","```\n","\n","**C. `readlines()` - List of Lines**\n","Reads all lines and returns them as a **list of strings**.\n","\n","```python\n","file = open(\"example.txt\", \"r\")\n","lines = file.readlines()\n","# lines = ['Hello\\n', 'World\\n']\n","for line in lines:\n","    print(line.strip()) # remove \\n\n","file.close()\n","\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 4. Writing to Files\n","\n","**A. Writing (`'w'`)**\n","Remember: `'w'` wipes the file clean first!\n","\n","```python\n","file = open(\"output.txt\", \"w\")\n","file.write(\"Hello World\\n\")\n","file.write(\"This is a new file.\")\n","file.close()\n","\n","```\n","\n","**B. Appending (`'a'`)**\n","Adds to the end without deleting existing content.\n","\n","```python\n","file = open(\"output.txt\", \"a\")\n","file.write(\"\\nThis line is appended.\")\n","file.close()\n","\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 5. The `with` Statement (Best Practice)\n","\n","Manually closing files with `.close()` is risky (what if your code crashes before it reaches that line?).\n","The `with` statement **automatically closes the file** for you, even if an error occurs. This is called a **Context Manager**.\n","\n","**Always use this approach!**\n","\n","```python\n","# The file is open ONLY inside this block\n","with open(\"data.txt\", \"w\") as f:\n","    f.write(\"Python is awesome!\")\n","    \n","# Automatically closed here.\n","print(\"File is closed now.\")\n","\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 6. Binary Files (Images/PDFs)\n","\n","To read/write non-text files, add `'b'` to the mode.\n","\n","```python\n","# Copying an image\n","with open(\"python_logo.png\", \"rb\") as source:\n","    data = source.read()\n","\n","with open(\"copy_logo.png\", \"wb\") as dest:\n","    dest.write(data)\n","\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 7. File Paths (Absolute vs Relative)\n","\n","* **Relative Path:** `\"data.txt\"` (Looks in the same folder as your script).\n","* **Absolute Path:** `\"C:/Users/Name/Documents/data.txt\"` (Full path).\n","\n","> **Tip:** If you are on Windows, use raw strings `r\"C:\\Users...\"` or forward slashes `/` to avoid escape character issues."],"metadata":{"id":"fbs9eYkIT3_P"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":211},"id":"hvpQAnm2T5Az","executionInfo":{"status":"error","timestamp":1770975271278,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":28,"user":{"displayName":"Vijaya Simha Reddy","userId":"02025652348724397650"}},"outputId":"870623bd-b9f3-412e-e1b6-8f053256a00f"},"execution_count":9,"outputs":[{"output_type":"error","ename":"FileNotFoundError","evalue":"[Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/drive/MyDrive/PythonPractise/PythonPractise/FileHandling/Data.txt'","traceback":["\u001b[0;31m---------------------------------------------------------------------------\u001b[0m","\u001b[0;31mFileNotFoundError\u001b[0m                         Traceback (most recent call last)","\u001b[0;32m/tmp/ipython-input-3700191906.py\u001b[0m in \u001b[0;36m<cell line: 0>\u001b[0;34m()\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;32m----> 1\u001b[0;31m \u001b[0mfile\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m=\u001b[0m \u001b[0mopen\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\"/drive/MyDrive/PythonPractise/PythonPractise/FileHandling/Data.txt\"\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1;32m      2\u001b[0m \u001b[0mprint\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0mfile\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m.\u001b[0m\u001b[0mread\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m      3\u001b[0m \u001b[0mfile\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m.\u001b[0m\u001b[0mclose\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[0;31mFileNotFoundError\u001b[0m: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/drive/MyDrive/PythonPractise/PythonPractise/FileHandling/Data.txt'"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"qdncOo3cWSKi"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
