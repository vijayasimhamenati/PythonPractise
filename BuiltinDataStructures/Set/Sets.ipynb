    "# Python Sets: Introduction & Internal Mechanics\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Set** in Python is a built-in data structure that represents an **unordered collection of unique elements**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, it mirrors a finite set found in mathematics. From an engineering perspective, it is implemented as a **Hash Table** (similar to a Dictionary, but with keys only and no values). This implementation detail dictates its primary characteristics: extremely fast membership testing () but a complete lack of order.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Key Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "To use sets effectively, you must understand these four pillars:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Unordered:** Sets do **not** record element position or insertion order.\n",
    "* *Implication:* You cannot access items via an index (e.g., `s[0]` raises `TypeError`).\n",
    "* *Implication:* Slicing is impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Distinct (Unique):** Duplicate values are automatically removed upon creation or addition.\n",
    "3. **Mutable:** You can add or remove elements after creation.\n",
    "4. **Heterogeneous:** You can mix data types (e.g., `int`, `str`, `tuple`) within a single set, **provided the elements are hashable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Creation Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "There are specific syntactic rules for creating sets, particularly when dealing with empty collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A. Literal Syntax `{}`\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard way to create a set with values.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Standard creation\n",
    "permissions = {\"read\", \"write\", \"execute\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Automatic Duplicate Removal\n",
    "# The '8080' appears twice but is stored once\n",
    "ports = {80, 443, 8080, 8080} \n",
    "print(ports) # Output: {80, 443, 8080}\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. The `set()` Constructor\n",
    "\n",
    "Used to convert other iterables into a set. This is the idiomatic way to remove duplicates from a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Convert List to Set (Deduplication)\n",
    "raw_ids = [101, 102, 101, 103]\n",
    "unique_ids = set(raw_ids) \n",
    "# Result: {101, 102, 103}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Convert String to Set (Unique Characters)\n",
    "chars = set(\"banana\")\n",
    "# Result: {'b', 'a', 'n'} (Order is random)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. The Empty Set Trap\n",
    "\n",
    "**Critical:** Empty curly braces `{}` create an **empty Dictionary**, not a Set. To create an empty set, you *must* use `set()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ❌ Creates a Dictionary\n",
    "empty_collection = {} \n",
    "print(type(empty_collection)) # <class 'dict'>\n",
    "\n",
    "# ✅ Creates a Set\n",
    "empty_set = set()\n",
    "print(type(empty_set)) # <class 'set'>\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. The \"Unordered\" Reality\n",
    "\n",
    "Beginners are often confused because when they print a set in Jupyter Notebooks or basic scripts, it *appears* sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This is an illusion.**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Display Artifact:** Many shells/IDEs choose to display sets in sorted order for readability.\n",
    "2. **Integer Hashing:** Small integers often hash to themselves, which can make them *appear* ordered in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, **never rely on this order**. It varies across Python versions, insertion histories, and execution environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# The order you see is NOT guaranteed\n",
    "s = {\"Python\", \"Java\", \"C++\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Iteration order is arbitrary\n",
    "for language in s:\n",
    "    print(language) \n",
    "# Output might be: Java, Python, C++ (or any other permutation)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. The Hashability Constraint\n",
    "\n",
    "While a set itself is mutable, **every element inside a set must be immutable (hashable).**\n",
    "\n",
    "Why? Because the set uses the element's **Hash Value** to determine its storage location. If an element (like a list) could change, its hash would change, and the set would lose track of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Allowed Elements:** Integers, Floats, Strings, Tuples, Booleans.\n",
    "* **Forbidden Elements:** Lists, Dictionaries, other Sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ✅ Valid: Tuple is immutable\n",
    "s = {1, (10, 20)} \n",
    "\n",
    "# ❌ Invalid: List is mutable\n",
    "# s = {1, [10, 20]} \n",
    "# Raises TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Basic Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`add(element)`:** Adds a single element. If it exists, does nothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "s = {1, 2}\n",
    "s.add(3)  # {1, 2, 3}\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Removing Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`remove(element)`:** Removes an item. Raises `KeyError` if not found.\n",
    "* **`discard(element)`:** Removes an item. Does **nothing** if not found (safer).\n",
    "* **`pop()`:** Removes and returns an **arbitrary** element. Since sets are unordered, you do not know which item will be popped.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "s = {\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "s.remove(\"A\")  # Removes \"A\"\n",
    "s.discard(\"Z\") # Does nothing (No error)\n",
    "item = s.pop() # Returns random element, e.g., \"B\"\n",

    "# Python Sets: Internal Representation & Hashing\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike Lists or Tuples, which are represented as contiguous arrays of pointers accessible by a sequential index (), **Sets** use a **Hash Table** structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "While a Set is backed by an array in memory, you cannot access elements via index because the position of an element depends on its **Hash Value**, not its insertion order. This architecture allows Sets to trade memory for speed, achieving **** performance for lookups and insertions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. The Hash Table Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "A Hash Table is essentially a sparse array (an array with many empty slots). To determine where to store an element (Key), Python applies a **Hash Function**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental logic for finding a slot index is:\n",
    "\n",

    "2. **Insert 10:** `10 % 10 = 0`. Store `10` at Index 0.\n",
    "3. **Insert 23:** `23 % 10 = 3`. Store `23` at Index 3.\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Handling Collisions\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Collision** occurs when two distinct keys map to the same index.\n",
    "*Example:* Insert `15` into the table above.\n",
    "`15 % 10 = 5`.\n",
    "Index 5 is already occupied by `5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collision Resolution Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Chaining (Transcript Model):** The slot at Index 5 becomes a pointer to a Linked List containing both `[5, 15]`.\n",
    "2. **Open Addressing (CPython Reality):** Python actually uses **Open Addressing** (Linear Probing). If Index 5 is full, it calculates a new index (Probe) based on a perturbation formula and tries again until it finds an empty slot.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Performance Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the location of an element is determined by math rather than scanning, operations are incredibly fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Operation | List (Array) | Set (Hash Table) | Why? |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| **Search** |  | **** | List must scan; Set jumps directly to index. |\n",
    "| **Insert** |  /  | **** | List may need to shift items; Set writes to empty slot. |\n",
    "| **Delete** |  | **** | List must shift items to close gap; Set just marks slot dummy. |\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** These are *Average Case* complexities. In the worst case (many collisions), a Set can degrade to , though Python's randomization makes this rare.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 4. Why Sets are Unordered (The Resizing Effect)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the lecture demonstration, adding the value `31` caused the entire print order of the set to change. This phenomenon is due to **Dynamic Resizing**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Load Factor\n",
    "\n",
    "Hash tables must remain sparse to maintain  speed. Python monitors the **Load Factor** (items / total slots).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Threshold:** When the table gets roughly  full.\n",
    "* **Action:** Python allocates a new, larger table (e.g., increasing size from ).\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Rehash\n",
    "\n",
    "When the table size changes, the modulo divisor changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Old:** `x % 16`\n",
    "* **New:** `x % 64`\n",
    "\n",
    "This changes the index of *every* element. The elements are scattered into new positions, completely altering the iteration order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Demonstration\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Small Set (Size 16 implied)\n",
    "s = {10, 20, 50} \n",
    "# Order might be: 50, 20, 10 (Based on % 16)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Trigger Resize\n",
    "s.add(31) \n",
    "# Table expands to Size 64\n",
    "# All keys rehashed with % 64\n",
    "# New Order: 10, 50, 20, 31 (Completely different)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Mechanism:** Sets use Hash Tables (Arrays + Hashing Function).\n",
    "* **Order:** Determined by `hash(value) % size`. It appears random and changes when the set grows.\n",
    "* **Speed:** Searching for an item is instant () because we calculate its address rather than searching for it.\n",
    "* **Constraint:** Only **Hashable** (Immutable) objects can be stored, because if an object changed its value, its hash would change, and it would become \"lost\" in the wrong slot."
