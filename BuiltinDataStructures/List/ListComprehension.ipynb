They are syntactic sugar derived from mathematical **set-builder notation** (e.g., ).\n","\n","While they are famous for writing \"one-liners,\" their primary engineering value lies in **readability** and **performance**. Comprehensions are often faster than equivalent `for` loops because their internal iteration is optimized in C, avoiding the overhead of repeated Python function calls (like `append`).\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 1. Basic Syntax & Logic\n","\n","The fundamental structure of a list comprehension is:\n","\n","```python\n","[expression for item in iterable]\n","\n","```\n","\n","### Comparison: Loop vs. Comprehension\n","\n","Consider the task of squaring numbers.\n","\n","**The \"For Loop\" Way:**\n","\n","```python\n","numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n","squares = []\n","\n","for num in numbers:\n","    squares.append(num ** 2)\n","\n","# Result: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n","\n","```\n","\n","**The \"Comprehension\" Way:**\n","\n","```python\n","numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n","\n","# \"Give me num squared for every num in numbers\"\n","squares = [num ** 2 for num in numbers]\n","\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 2. Filtering (The `if` Clause)\n","\n","You can filter elements by adding an `if` condition **after** the `for` loop. This acts like the `filter()` function.\n","\n","### Syntax\n","\n","```python\n","[expression for item in iterable if condition]\n","\n","```\n","\n","### Engineering Example\n","\n","Extracting active users from a list of user objects (dicts).\n","\n","```python\n","users = [\n","    {'name': 'Alice', 'active': True},\n","    {'name': 'Bob', 'active': False},\n","    {'name': 'Charlie', 'active': True}\n","]\n","\n","# Extract names of active users only\n","active_names = [user['name'] for user in users if user['active']]\n","\n","# Result: ['Alice', 'Charlie']\n","\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 3. Conditional Logic (The `if-else` Ternary)\n","\n","This is a common point of confusion. If you want to transform the data conditionally (e.g., \"Map X to Y if True, else Z\"), the condition must go **before** the `for` keyword. This uses Python's ternary operator.\n","\n","### Syntax\n","\n","```python\n","[value_if_true if condition else value_if_false for item in iterable]\n","\n","```\n","\n","### Engineering Example\n","\n","Labeling transaction statuses.\n","\n","```python\n","transactions = [100, -50, 20, -10]\n","\n","# Label as \"Credit\" or \"Debit\"\n","labels = [\"Credit\" if t > 0 else \"Debit\" for t in transactions]\n","\n","# Result: ['Credit', 'Debit', 'Credit', 'Debit']\n","\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 4. Nested Comprehensions (Flattening)\n","\n","You can nest loops within a comprehension. The order of loops is exactly the same as if you wrote them nested conventionally: **Outer Loop first, Inner Loop second**.\n","\n","### Syntax\n","\n","```python\n","[expression for outer in outer_list for inner in inner_list]\n","\n","```\n","\n","### Engineering Example: Flattening a Matrix\n","\n","```python\n","matrix = [\n","    [1, 2, 3],\n","    [4, 5, 6],\n","    [7, 8, 9]\n","]\n","\n","# Flattening into a 1D list\n","# Read as: \"For each row in matrix, and for each num in that row, give me num\"\n","flat = [num for row in matrix for num in row]\n","\n","# Result: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n","\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 5. Performance & Memory Considerations\n","\n","### Speed\n","\n","List comprehensions are generally faster than `for` loops because the accumulation of the list is done in C code rather than Python bytecode (`list.append`). However, `map()` functions can sometimes be faster for very simple operations if written in C.\n","\n","### Memory (The Trap)\n","\n","A list comprehension is **Eagerly Evaluated**. It generates the *entire* list in memory immediately.\n","\n","* **Small Data:** Perfect.\n","* **Huge Data (e.g., 100M records):** Dangerous. It can cause an `MemoryError`.\n","\n","**Solution:** Use **Generator Expressions** for large datasets. They use `()` instead of `[]` and yield items one by one (Lazy Evaluation).\n","\n","```python\n","# List Comprehension (Memory Intensive)\n","# Creates a list of 1,000,000 integers in RAM\n","large_list = [x**2 for x in range(1000000)]\n","\n","# Generator Expression (Memory Efficient)\n","# Creates an iterator object (size < 100 bytes)\n","large_gen = (x**2 for x in range(1000000))\n","\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Summary Table\n","\n","| Pattern | Syntax | Logic Equivalent |\n","| --- | --- | --- |\n","| **Basic** | `[x for x in data]` | `map` |\n","| **Filter** | `[x for x in data if cond]` | `filter` |\n","| **Transform** | `[a if cond else b for x in data]` | `map` with logic |\n","| **Nested** | `[x for y in data for x in y]` | Nested loops |\n","\n","### Best Practice\n","\n","> **\"Flat is better than nested.\"** (The Zen of Python).\n","> If your comprehension spans more than 2 lines or has multiple nested loops/conditions, it is often better to write a standard `for` loop for the sake of readability and maintainability."],"metadata":{"id":"U-RwFQBR6B3e"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"_9ef1Nv56Czs"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
