It serves as a foundational tool for managing collections of data.\n","\n","## 1. What is a List?\n","\n","At its core, a list is an **ordered collection of heterogeneous elements**.\n","\n","* **Ordered:** Elements are stored in a specific sequence and accessed via indices.\n","* **Heterogeneous:** Unlike arrays in languages like C or Java, a Python list can contain different data types (e.g., integers, floats, strings) mixed together.\n","* **Mutable:** You can modify the list (add, remove, or change elements) after it has been created.\n","* **Duplicates Allowed:** Lists can contain the same value multiple times.\n","\n","## 2. Creating a List\n","\n","There are several ways to define a list in Python:\n","\n","* **Using Square Brackets `[]`:**\n","```python\n","numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n","mixed_list = [1, \"Hello\", 3.5]\n","empty_list = []\n","\n","```\n","\n","\n","* **Using the `list()` Constructor:**\n","This converts other iterable objects (like tuples or strings) into a list.\n","```python\n","# From a tuple\n","l2 = list((1, 2, 3, 4))\n","\n","# From a string (creates a list of characters)\n","l3 = list(\"abcde\") # Output: ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']\n","\n","```\n","\n","\n","\n","## 3. Memory Representation & Indexing\n","\n","When you create a list, Python reserves a block of memory to store references (pointers) to the actual data objects.\n","\n","### Indexing\n","\n","Lists support bidirectional indexing:\n","\n","* **Positive Indexing:** Starts from `0` (left to right).\n","* **Negative Indexing:** Starts from `-1` (right to left).\n","\n","```python\n","my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40]\n","# Accessing elements\n","print(my_list[0])   # Output: 10 (First element)\n","print(my_list[-1])  # Output: 40 (Last element)\n","\n","```\n","\n","## 4. Key Characteristics\n","\n","### A. Heterogeneous Nature\n","\n","A single list can hold various data types because it stores **references** to objects, not the objects themselves directly in the contiguous memory block.\n","\n","```python\n","# Valid Python List\n","data = [7, 3.2, \"Python\", True]\n","\n","```\n","\n","### B. Mutability\n","\n","Lists can be changed in place without creating a new object.\n","\n","* **Modify:** Change an existing element.\n","```python\n","L = [1, 2, 3]\n","L[1] = 15  # L becomes [1, 15, 3]\n","\n","```\n","\n","\n","* **Add:** expanding the list size.\n","```python\n","L.append(25) # Adds 25 to the end\n","\n","```\n","\n","\n","* **Remove:** Deleting elements.\n","```python\n","L.remove(15) # Removes the value 15\n","\n","```\n","\n","\n","\n","### Summary Definition\n","\n","> A List is a **mutable**, **ordered** sequence of **heterogeneous** elements that allows **duplicates**."],"metadata":{"id":"7TW1bKQSAVjK"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n","mixed_list = [1, \"Hello\", 3.5]\n","empty_list = []"],"metadata":{"id":"0DizEcfPN8Rf","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1771334508687,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"Vijaya Simha Reddy","userId":"02025652348724397650"}}},"execution_count":8,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"OMwhsKKrPAZL","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1771334508748,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":57,"user":{"displayName":"Vijaya Simha Reddy","userId":"02025652348724397650"}}},"execution_count":8,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Python Lists: Indexing & Slicing (Part 1: Accessing Data)\n","\n","Indexing and Slicing are fundamental operations in Python, applicable to almost all sequence types (Lists, Tuples, Strings, Bytes).

Scenario 1: Contiguous Slices (No Step)\n","\n","**Rule:** When assigning to a slice without a step (e.g., `L[start:stop]`), the length of the slice being replaced does **not** need to match the length of the new values.\n","\n","**Requirement:** The value on the right-hand side (RHS) **must be an iterable** (list, tuple, string). You cannot assign a single scalar value.\n","\n","This flexibility allows for three powerful operations:\n","\n","1. **Shrinking:** Replacing a large slice with fewer elements.\n","2. **Growing:** Replacing a small slice with more elements.\n","3. **Insertion:** Assigning to a zero-width slice.\n","\n","```python\n","# Initial List\n","alpha = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']\n","\n","# 1.

The `+` Operator (Create New)\n","\n","The `+` operator creates a **new list object** containing elements from both operands. The original lists remain unchanged.\n","\n","**Constraint:** You can only concatenate a `list` with another `list`.

Frequency Analysis (`count`)\n","\n","The `count()` method returns the number of times a specific element appears in the list.\n","\n","### Syntax\n","\n","```python\n","count = list.count(element)\n","\n","```\n","\n","### Engineering Example\n","\n","```python\n","votes = [\"A\", \"B\", \"A\", \"C\", \"A\", \"B\"]\n","\n","# Frequency distribution\n","a_votes = votes.count(\"A\") # 3\n","b_votes = votes.count(\"B\") # 2\n","\n","print(f\"Candidate A received {a_votes} votes.\")\n","\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 3. Reversing Order (`reverse`)\n","\n","The `reverse()` method flips the order of elements in the list **in-place**.\n","\n","### Syntax\n","\n","```python\n","list.reverse()\n","\n","```\n","\n","### Key Distinction\n","\n","* **`list.reverse()`:** Modifies the original list. Returns `None`.\n","* **`list[::-1]`:** Creates a **new** list copy in reverse order.\n","* **`reversed(list)`:** Returns an **iterator** (memory efficient) for looping.\n","\n","```python\n","data = [10, 20, 30, 40]\n","\n","# In-Place Modification\n","data.reverse()\n","print(data) # Output: [40, 30, 20, 10]\n","\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 4. Sorting (`sort`)\n","\n","The `sort()` method arranges elements in ascending order by default. Python uses **Timsort**, a hybrid stable sorting algorithm derived from Merge Sort and Insertion Sort, offering O(N log N) performance.\n","\n","### Syntax\n","\n","```python\n","list.sort(key=None, reverse=False)\n","\n","```\n","\n","* **`reverse`:** If `True`, sorts in descending order.\n","* **`key`:** A function (callable) that transforms each element before comparison.\n","\n","### A. Basic Sorting (Ascending/Descending)\n","\n","```python\n","metrics = [50, 10, 80, 30]\n","\n","# Ascending (Default)\n","metrics.sort()\n","# Result: [10, 30, 50, 80]\n","\n","# Descending\n","metrics.sort(reverse=True)\n","# Result: [80, 50, 30, 10]\n","\n","```\n","\n","### B. Custom Sorting with `key`\n","\n","The `key` argument is powerful. It allows you to sort complex objects based on a specific criteria without modifying the actual data.\n","\n","#### Scenario 1: Sort by String Length\n","\n","By default, strings are sorted alphabetically. To sort by length, pass the built-in `len` function as the key.\n","\n","```python\n","words = [\"apple\", \"bat\", \"banana\", \"cat\"]\n","\n","# Sort by length of word (Shortest -> Longest)\n","words.sort(key=len)\n","\n","print(words)\n","# Output: ['bat', 'cat', 'apple', 'banana']\n","\n","```\n","\n","#### Scenario 2: Case-Insensitive Sort\n","\n","In ASCII, uppercase letters (A=65) have lower values than lowercase letters (a=97). This causes \"Zebra\" to come before \"apple\". To fix this, normalize the case using `str.lower`.\n","\n","```python\n","users = [\"admin\", \"Guest\", \"root\", \"User\"]\n","\n","# 1. Standard Sort (Case-Sensitive / ASCII)\n","users.sort()\n","print(users)\n","# Output: ['Guest', 'User', 'admin', 'root'] (Upper case first)\n","\n","# 2. Case-Insensitive Sort (Normalize to lowercase for comparison)\n","users.sort(key=str.lower)\n","print(users)\n","# Output: ['admin', 'Guest', 'root', 'User'] (Alphabetical)\n","\n","```\n","\n","### Summary Table: Sorting & Reversing\n","\n","| Method | Returns | Effect | Arguments |\n","| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n","| **`reverse()`** | `None` | In-place reversal | None |\n","| **`sort()`** | `None` | In-place sort | `key`, `reverse` |\n","| **`sorted(L)`** | New List | **New sorted list** | `key`, `reverse` |\n","| **`reversed(L)`** | Iterator | Returns iterator | None |"],"metadata":{"id":"QNgOyS-F5MVD"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"j3lyKlyS5olR"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
