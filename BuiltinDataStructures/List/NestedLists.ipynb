In Python, this is the standard way to represent **Multidimensional Arrays**, such as Matrices (2D) or Tensors (3D+).\n","\n","Because Python lists are heterogeneous, a nested list does not need to be rectangular (i.e., rows can have different lengths), though in engineering contexts like Data Science or Image Processing, we typically enforce a rectangular structure.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 1. Creating Nested Lists\n","\n","You can define a nested list manually or generate it dynamically.\n","\n","### A. Manual Declaration (The Matrix)\n","\n","This represents a 3x3 matrix (3 rows, 3 columns).\n","\n","```python\n","matrix = [\n","    [1, 2, 3],  # Row 0\n","    [4, 5, 6],  # Row 1\n","    [7, 8, 9]   # Row 2\n","]\n","\n","```\n","\n","### B. Dynamic Generation (List Comprehension)\n","\n","This is the standard engineering pattern for initializing a grid (e.g., a game board or image buffer).\n","\n","```python\n","# Create a 3x3 grid initialized to 0\n","# Logic: Create a row of 3 zeros, then do that 3 times.\n","grid = [[0 for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]\n","\n","# Result:\n","# [\n","#   [0, 0, 0],\n","#   [0, 0, 0],\n","#   [0, 0, 0]\n","# ]\n","\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 2. Accessing Elements (2D Indexing)\n","\n","To access an element in a nested list, you chain the index operators `[]`.\n","\n","* **Syntax:** `list[row_index][column_index]`\n","\n","```python\n","matrix = [\n","    [10, 20, 30],\n","    [40, 50, 60],\n","    [70, 80, 90]\n","]\n","\n","# 1. Accessing a Row\n","row_1 = matrix[1]\n","# Output: [40, 50, 60]\n","\n","# 2. Accessing a Specific Element\n","element = matrix[1][2]\n","# Logic: Go to Row 1 -> [40, 50, 60], then take Index 2 -> 60\n","# Output: 60\n","\n","# 3. Accessing via Negative Indexing\n","last_item = matrix[-1][-1]\n","# Output: 90\n","\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 3. Iterating Through Nested Lists\n","\n","To process every element (e.g., to display a grid or sum values), use **Nested Loops**.\n","\n","```python\n","matrix = [\n","    [1, 2, 3],\n","    [4, 5, 6],\n","    [7, 8, 9]\n","]\n","\n","# Standard Nested Traversal\n","for row in matrix:\n","    for item in row:\n","        print(item, end=\" \")\n","    print() # Newline after each row\n","\n","# Output:\n","# 1 2 3\n","# 4 5 6\n","# 7 8 9\n","\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 4. The \"Shallow Copy Trap\" (Critical Engineering Concept)\n","\n","When initializing lists, a common mistake is using the multiplication operator `*` incorrectly on mutable objects.\n","\n","### The Buggy Way\n","\n","```python\n","# ⚠️ DANGEROUS: Creates 3 references to the SAME inner list\n","matrix = [[0] * 3] * 3\n","\n","# Let's try to modify just the first element (0,0)\n","matrix[0][0] = 99\n","\n","print(matrix)\n","# Expected: [[99, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]\n","# Actual:   [[99, 0, 0], [99, 0, 0], [99, 0, 0]]\n","\n","```\n","\n","**Why?** The outer list contains three pointers pointing to the **exact same** inner list object in memory. Modifying one row modifies all of them because they are effectively the same entity.\n","\n","### The Correct Way\n","\n","Use a list comprehension to force the creation of **new, independent** list objects for each row.\n","\n","```python\n","# ✅ SAFE: Executes the inner list creation 3 separate times\n","matrix = [[0] * 3 for _ in range(3)]\n","matrix[0][0] = 99\n","# Result: [[99, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]\n","\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 5. Matrix Operations (Transposing)\n","\n","A common operation in algorithms is **Transposing** a matrix (swapping rows and columns).\n","\n","```python\n","matrix = [\n","    [1, 2],\n","    [3, 4],\n","    [5, 6]\n","]\n","# Shape: 3x2 (3 Rows, 2 Cols)\n","\n","# Goal: Transpose to 2x3\n","# [[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]]\n","\n","# Method 1: List Comprehension\n","transpose = [[row[i] for row in matrix] for i in range(2)]\n","\n","# Method 2: The 'zip' Trick (Pythonic)\n","# zip(*matrix) unpacks the rows and zips them column-wise\n","transpose_zip = list(map(list, zip(*matrix)))\n","\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Summary Table\n","\n","| Operation | Syntax | Complexity |\n","| --- | --- | --- |\n","| **Access** | `L[row][col]` | O(1) |\n","| **Create (Safe)** | `[[0]*C for _ in range(R)]` | O(R*C) |\n","| **Iterate** | `for row in L: for x in row:` | O(N) (Total Elements) |\n","| **Flatten** | `[x for row in L for x in row]` | O(N) |"],"metadata":{"id":"qktpwyzw6QUK"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"fbqFjwOG6bSm"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
