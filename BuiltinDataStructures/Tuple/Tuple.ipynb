    "# Python Tuples: Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Tuple** is a built-in data structure in Python that functions very similarly to a List, with one critical difference: **Immutability**.\n",
    "\n",
    "While a List is designed to be modified (mutable), a Tuple is designed to be \"read-only\" after creation. This makes tuples lightweight, faster for iteration, and suitable for protecting data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ordered:** Elements maintain their insertion order and are accessed via indices.\n",
    "2. **Heterogeneous:** Can store mixed data types (integers, strings, objects).\n",
    "3. **Duplicates Allowed:** Can contain the same value multiple times.\n",
    "4. **Immutable:** Once defined, elements cannot be added, removed, or changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Creation Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Python offers several syntactic ways to create tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A. Literal Syntax `()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard way to create a tuple is using parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Homogeneous Tuple\n",
    "point = (10, 20)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Heterogeneous Tuple\n",
    "user_record = (1, \"Alice\", True)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Empty Tuple\n",
    "empty = ()\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. The `tuple()` Constructor\n",
    "\n",
    "Converts other iterables (lists, strings, ranges) into a tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# From a List\n",
    "data = tuple([1, 2, 3]) \n",
    "\n",
    "# From a String (creates a tuple of chars)\n",
    "chars = tuple(\"Python\") \n",
    "# Output: ('P', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 'n')\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. The \"Single Element\" Pitfall\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a common bug for beginners. Parentheses in Python are also used for mathematical grouping `(1 + 2)`. To distinguish a tuple, you **must** include a trailing comma.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ❌ This is an Integer, NOT a tuple\n",
    "num = (10) \n",
    "print(type(num)) # <class 'int'>\n",
    "\n",
    "# ✅ This is a Tuple\n",
    "tup = (10,) \n",
    "print(type(tup)) # <class 'tuple'>\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Tuple Packing (Implicit Creation)\n",
    "\n",
    "Python allows you to omit parentheses entirely. If you assign multiple values to a single variable, Python \"packs\" them into a tuple automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Tuple Packing\n",
    "coordinates = 10, 20, 30\n",
    "\n",
    "print(coordinates)       # Output: (10, 20, 30)\n",
    "print(type(coordinates)) # Output: <class 'tuple'>\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Memory & Immutability\n",
    "\n",
    "A tuple is stored as a fixed-size block of memory containing references to objects. Because it is immutable, Python does not need to allocate \"extra\" space for future expansion (unlike lists).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Immutability Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data Integrity:** If you pass a tuple to a function, you are guaranteed that the function cannot alter your data.\n",
    "* **Performance:** Tuples are slightly faster to create and iterate over than lists due to memory optimizations.\n",
    "* **Dictionary Keys:** Because they are immutable (and hashable), tuples can be used as keys in a dictionary (Lists cannot).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "data = (10, 20, 30)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Reading is allowed\n",
    "print(data[0]) # Output: 10\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Modification raises Error\n",
    "# data[0] = 99 \n",
    "# Raises: TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Access & Traversal\n",
    "\n",
    "Since tuples are ordered sequences, they support the same Indexing and Slicing operations as Lists and Strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "server_config = (\"192.168.1.1\", 8080, \"admin\", \"production\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Indexing\n",
    "ip = server_config[0]      # \"192.168.1.1\"\n",

    "# Python Tuple Comprehensions & Generator Expressions\n",
    "A common point of confusion for Python developers transitioning from Lists to Tuples is the concept of **Tuple Comprehension**.\n",

    "In Python, there is **no direct syntax** for a tuple comprehension.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `[x for x in data]` creates a **List**.\n",
    "* `{x for x in data}` creates a **Set** (or Dict if key-value pairs are used).\n",
    "* `(x for x in data)` **does NOT create a Tuple**. It creates a **Generator Object**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a tuple using comprehension logic, we must explicitly **materialize** that generator into a tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. The Generator Distinction\n",
    "\n",
    "If you attempt to use the exact syntax of a list comprehension but swap square brackets `[]` for parentheses `()`, you get a generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The \"Silent\" Generator\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# List Comprehension (Eagerly Evaluated)\n",
    "list_comp = [x * 2 for x in range(5)]\n",
    "print(type(list_comp))  # <class 'list'>\n",

    "print(gen_expr)         # <generator object <genexpr> at 0x...>\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a literal **Tuple**, you must consume this generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Construction Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two primary ways to achieve \"Tuple Comprehension.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method A: The `tuple()` Constructor (Standard Practice)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most readable and Pythonic approach. You pass the generator expression directly into the `tuple()` constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Create a tuple of squares\n",
    "squares = tuple(x**2 for x in range(1, 6))\n",
    "# Result: (1, 4, 9, 16, 25)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Processing strings\n",
    "raw_headers = [\"  ID  \", \"Name \", \"  Role\"]\n",
    "clean_headers = tuple(h.strip().upper() for h in raw_headers)\n",
    "# Result: ('ID', 'NAME', 'ROLE')\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method B: Tuple Unpacking (The \"Hack\")\n",
    "\n",
    "This method relies on Python's star-unpacking `*` operator inside a tuple literal. While technically valid, it is syntactically noisy and less readable than Method A.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Logic:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a generator: `(x for x in range(5))`\n",
    "2. Unpack all items: `*`\n",
    "3. Enclose in tuple parenthesis: `(*..., )`\n",
    "4. **Crucial:** Ensure a trailing comma if single-element ambiguity exists (though the syntax `(*(gen),)` handles this, the trailing comma is a general tuple rule).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# The Syntax: (*(generator), )\n",
    "# Note the trailing comma is generally good practice in single-line tuple literals, \n",
    "# though Python handles *(gen), implicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Unpacking a range into a tuple\n",
    "nums = (*(x for x in range(5)), )\n",
    "\n",
    "print(nums) \n",
    "# Output: (0, 1, 2, 3, 4)\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Filtering and Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like list comprehensions, we can apply `if` conditions to filter data before it becomes a tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario: Filtering Log Levels\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "logs = [\"INFO: Start\", \"ERROR: DB Fail\", \"WARN: Low Memory\", \"ERROR: Timeout\"]\n",

    "# Extract only error messages\n",
    "errors = tuple(\n",

    "## 4. Engineering Nuance: Why no `(x for x)`?\n",
    "\n",
    "Why didn't Python make `(x for x)` automatically return a tuple?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Memory Efficiency (Lazy Evaluation):** Generators yield items one by one. If you are iterating over 1 billion rows, a tuple (which is immutable and eager) would crash your RAM. A generator uses constant memory. Python defaults `()` to generators for this reason.\n",
    "2. **Immutability:** Tuples are immutable. To create a tuple via comprehension, Python effectively has to build a list internally or consume the iterator entirely before freezing it into a tuple. Explicitly calling `tuple()` signals that you understand this memory cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Tip\n",
