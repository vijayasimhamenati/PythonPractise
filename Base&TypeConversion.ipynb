Base Conversions\n","\n","By default, Python treats numbers as **Base 10 (Decimal)**. However, you can represent integers in other bases using specific prefixes.\n","\n","### **Integer Prefixes**\n","\n","* **Binary (Base 2):** Prefix with `0b` (e.g., `0b1010` is 10)\n","* **Octal (Base 8):** Prefix with `0o` (e.g., `0o12` is 10)\n","* **Hexadecimal (Base 16):** Prefix with `0x` (e.g., `0xA` is 10)\n","\n","### **Built-in Conversion Functions**\n","\n","To convert a decimal integer into a string representation of another base:\n","\n","* `bin(number)`: Returns a binary string.\n","* `oct(number)`: Returns an octal string.\n","* `hex(number)`: Returns a hexadecimal string.\n","\n","> **Note:** These functions return **strings**, not integers. To do math with them, Python converts them back to decimal internally.\n","\n","### **Converting Back to Decimal**\n","\n","The `int()` function can take a second argument: `int(value, base)`.\n","\n","```python\n","print(int(\"1010\", 2))   # Output: 10\n","print(int(\"A\", 16))      # Output: 10\n","\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 2. Type Conversions (Type Casting)\n","\n","Python uses two types of conversion: **Implicit** and **Explicit**.\n","\n","### **Implicit Conversion**\n","\n","Python automatically converts one data type to another to prevent data loss. For example, adding an integer and a float results in a float.\n","\n","```python\n","x = 5       # int\n","y = 2.5     # float\n","z = x + y   # z is 7.5 (float)\n","\n","```\n","\n","### **Explicit Conversion (Casting)**\n","\n","This is when you manually change the type using constructor functions.\n","\n","| Function | Description | Example |\n","| --- | --- | --- |\n","| **`int()`** | Converts to an integer (truncates decimals). | `int(3.9)` → `3` |\n","| **`float()`** | Converts to a floating-point number. | `float(5)` → `5.0` |\n","| **`str()`** | Converts almost any object to a string. | `str(100)` → `\"100\"` |\n","| **`list()`** | Converts an iterable (like a tuple or string) to a list. | `list(\"Hi\")` → `['H', 'i']` |\n","| **`bool()`** | Converts to True or False. | `bool(0)` → `False` |\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 3. The \"Truthiness\" of Types\n","\n","In Python, every object has a boolean value. Understanding this helps avoid bugs during type conversion to `bool()`.\n","\n","* **Falsy values:** `0`, `0.0`, `None`, `\"\"` (empty string), `[]` (empty list), `{}` (empty dict).\n","* **Truthy values:** Everything else (including the string `\"False\"` or the number `-1`).\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 4. Common Pitfalls\n","\n","* **Formatting:** If you use `hex(255)`, you get `'0xff'`. If you want just the letters `ff`, you should use the `format()` function or f-strings:\n","```python\n","print(f\"{255:x}\") # Output: 'ff'\n","\n","```\n","\n","\n","* **String to Int:** You can only convert a string to an integer if the string looks like a number. `int(\"10.5\")` will throw an error; you must go `int(float(\"10.5\"))`.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"qmGePc6sF5c1"},"id":"qmGePc6sF5c1"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"c98ae4df-36d4-43ce-8412-59cdeeebad8c","metadata":{"id":"c98ae4df-36d4-43ce-8412-59cdeeebad8c"},"outputs":[],"source":["#int(str)"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.11"},"colab":{"provenance":[]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
