    "# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Introduction & Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. The OOP Paradigm\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is not just syntax; it is a **programming paradigm**—a style of organizing code. As applications grow in complexity, procedural code (just writing instructions in sequence) becomes difficult to manage. OOP provides a structured approach to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Organize large codebases** efficiently.\n",
    "* **Facilitate teamwork** by modularizing responsibilities.\n",
    "* **Promote Reusability** of code across different parts of a project or different projects entirely.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concepts of OOP are borrowed directly from engineering disciplines like Civil, Mechanical, and Electronic engineering, where designs (blueprints) are separated from the actual manufactured products.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Core Concepts: Class vs. Object\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental distinction in OOP is between the **Class** and the **Object**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Class (The Blueprint)\n",
    "\n",
    "A Class is a logical definition, a template, or a blueprint. It defines *what* something should be, but it does not exist as a physical entity in memory until used. It contains the definitions for data and behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Object (The Instance)\n",
    "\n",
    "An Object is the physical realization (instance) of that Class. It consumes memory and has actual data. You can create infinite objects from a single class definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Engineering Analogies\n",
    "\n",
    "| Discipline | Class (Blueprint/Design) | Object (Real Instance) |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| **Civil Engineering** | **House Plan:** Defines where walls, doors, and windows go. | **The House:** The physical building you live in. Multiple houses can be built from one plan. |\n",
    "| **Automobile Eng.** | **Car Design:** Specifications for engine size, chassis, transmission. | **The Car:** The actual vehicle on the road. |\n",
    "| **Electronics** | **Circuit Diagram:** Schematic of a Television. | **The TV:** The physical device in your living room. |\n",
    "| **Software** | **Browser Code:** The program definition (Chrome.exe). | **Window/Tab:** An active instance of the browser running on your OS. |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. OOP in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is inherently object-oriented. Everything in Python—integers, strings, functions, lists—is an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create a variable, you are creating an **instance** (object) of a specific **class**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# 'x' is an object (instance) of the class 'int'\n",
    "x = 100 \n",
    "print(type(x))  # Output: <class 'int'>\n",
    "\n",
    "# 'prices' is an object of the class 'list'\n",
    "prices = [19.99, 4.50, 10.00]\n",
    "print(type(prices)) # Output: <class 'list'>\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Anatomy of a Class\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming terms, a class encapsulates two specific things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Properties (Data):** The information the object holds.\n",
    "* *Analogy:* A car's color, engine type, number of seats.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Methods (Functions):** The operations or behaviors the object can perform.\n",
    "* *Analogy:* Accelerate, brake, turn signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. The Pillars of OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are four main pillars (Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism), this introduction focuses on the first two, which deal with data integrity and design.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A. Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation is the bundling of **data** (properties) and the **methods** (functions) that manipulate that data into a single unit (the Class).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Concept:** Think of a capsule. The contents are held together and protected.\n",
    "* **Real World:** A Television set. The screen, buttons, and internal wiring are all encapsulated inside a single plastic casing. You treat it as one unit (\"The TV\"), not as a pile of loose wires.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Abstraction & Data Hiding\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction is the concept of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of the object to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The \"How\" vs. The \"What\":** The user needs to know *what* an object does, not *how* it does it.\n",
    "* **Data Hiding:** By using methods to access data, we prevent direct, unsafe access to the internal state of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy: Driving a Car**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Abstraction:** To drive, you use the **Interface** (Steering wheel, pedals, gear stick). You do not need to understand the combustion physics occurring inside the engine. The complexity is \"abstracted away.\"\n",
    "* **Data Hiding:** You cannot manually inject fuel into the cylinders while driving. The engine (data) is hidden under the hood; you can only affect it using the gas pedal (method).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Example: Abstraction with Python Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use a Python list, you rely on abstraction every day.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "data = [1, 5, 2]\n",
    "\n",
    "# You call the method .sort()\n",
    "data.sort()\n",
    "\n",
    "# RESULT: You know the list is now sorted.\n",
    "# ABSTRACTION: You do not know (or care) if Python used Merge Sort, \n",
    "# Quick Sort, or Bubble Sort internally. The complexity is hidden.\n",
    "\n",
    "```"

    "# Python Classes: The Constructor (`__init__`) and `self`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous module, we defined a basic `Rectangle` class with hardcoded values. However, in real-world engineering, we rarely want every object to be identical. We need a way to initialize objects with specific, dynamic data at the moment of creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This brings us to two fundamental concepts in Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): the **Constructor** (`__init__`) and the **Instance Reference** (`self`).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. The Constructor: `__init__`\n",
    "\n",
    "The constructor is a special method that is **automatically invoked** when you create a new instance of a class. Its primary role is **Initialization**—setting up the object's initial state (properties) before the object is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the constructor is named `__init__` (short for initialization).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hardcoded vs. Dynamic Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, our `Rectangle` class forced every rectangle to have a length of 10 and a breadth of 5. This is rigid. By adding parameters to the `__init__` method, we can enforce that every specific rectangle is created with its own unique dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Rectangle:\n",
    "    # The Constructor accepting parameters\n",
    "    def __init__(self, length, breadth):\n",
    "        self.length = length  # Assign parameter 'length' to instance variable 'self.length'\n",
    "        self.breadth = breadth\n",

    "# 2. Passes 15 to length, 8 to breadth\n",
    "r1 = Rectangle(15, 8) \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advanced: Default Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like standard functions, constructors support **Default Arguments**. This allows flexibility: users can specify dimensions if they want, or fall back to standard defaults if they don't.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Rectangle:\n",
    "    # Default dimensions are 1x1 unit square\n",
    "    def __init__(self, length=1, breadth=1):\n",
    "        self.length = length\n",
    "        self.breadth = breadth\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage Scenarios:\n",
    "r1 = Rectangle(15, 8)  # Custom: 15x8\n",
    "r2 = Rectangle(5)      # Partial: 5x1 (breadth defaults to 1)\n",
    "r3 = Rectangle()       # Default: 1x1\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Understanding `self`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `self` parameter is often a source of confusion for developers coming from other languages (where it might be implicit, like `this` in Java/C++). In Python, `self` is **explicit**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is `self`?\n",
    "\n",
    "`self` is a reference to the **Current Object (Instance)** being operated on.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you define a class, you are defining a blueprint. When you create an object (e.g., `r1 = Rectangle(10, 20)`), that specific object in memory needs a way to refer to its *own* data. `self` is that reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proof of Identity\n",
    "\n",
    "We can verify that `self` is actually the exact same object as the variable we created (`r1`) by inspecting their memory addresses using the `id()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class IDCheck:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"Inside Constructor (self ID): {id(self)}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Create Object\n",
    "my_obj = IDCheck()\n",
    "# Output: Inside Constructor (self ID): 300830...\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Check Object from Outside\n",
    "print(f\"Outside Class (my_obj ID):      {id(my_obj)}\")\n",
    "# Output: Outside Class (my_obj ID):      300830...\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:** The IDs match. `my_obj` (outside) and `self` (inside) are two different names pointing to the **same memory location**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Complete Engineering Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the refined `Rectangle` class implementing a dynamic constructor, default arguments, and self-referential methods.\n",

    "\n",
    "These terms are often used interchangeably.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Object:** A generic term for a data structure created from a class (e.g., `r1` is an object).\n",
    "* **Instance:** Often used to emphasize distinct identity (e.g., `r1` is a specific *instance* of the `Rectangle` class, distinct from `r2`).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Instance Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Instance variables are variables whose values are **unique to each object** created from the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Scope:** They belong to a specific object, not the class itself.\n",
    "* **Definition:** They are typically defined inside the `__init__` method.\n",
    "* **Syntax:** They must be prefixed with `self.` (e.g., `self.length`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Where to Define Instance Variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "While Python allows flexibility, there is a strict best practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A. Inside `__init__` (Standard Practice)\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables defined here are guaranteed to exist as soon as the object is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Rectangle:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, length, breadth):\n",
    "        # These are Instance Variables\n",
    "        # They are unique: r1 has its own length, r2 has its own length\n",
    "        self.length = length\n",
    "        self.breadth = breadth\n",
    "\n",

    "#### B. Inside other methods (Risky)\n",
    "\n",
    "You *can* define variables in other methods, but they won't exist until that specific method is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Test:\n",
    "    def set_data(self):\n",
    "        self.score = 100  # 'score' is created only when set_data() runs\n",

    "#### C. Outside the Class (Monkey Patching)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can dynamically add variables to an object from outside the class.\n",

    "## 2. Instance Methods\n",

    "### Key Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **First Parameter (`self`):** The first parameter of an instance method **must** be `self`. This allows the method to access the calling object's data.\n",

    "## 2. Syntax and Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "To define a static method in Python, we use the **`@staticmethod`** decorator.\n",

    "### Key Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Decorator:** You must use `@staticmethod`.\n",
    "2. **No `self` or `cls`:** Static methods **do not** take `self` or `cls` as their first parameter. They only take the parameters you explicitly pass to them.\n",
    "3. **Access:** They cannot access instance variables (`self.x`) or class variables (`cls.y`) directly.\n",

    "Let's add a static method to our `Rectangle` class that allows us to calculate an area *without* creating a Rectangle object first.\n",

    "You technically can, but using `@staticmethod` provides **Namespace Organization**.\n",
    "\n",

    "* It clarifies the intent to other developers: \"This function is related to Rectangles, but doesn't change them.\"\n",

    "### Common Pitfall: The `TypeError`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you define a method inside a class without `self` and without `@staticmethod`, and try to call it on an object, Python will raise a `TypeError`.\n",
