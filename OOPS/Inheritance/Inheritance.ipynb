    "# Python Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. The Concept of Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is a fundamental principle of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows a new class (Child) to borrow features (properties and methods) from an existing class (Parent).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Reusability:** You write the code once in the parent class and reuse it in multiple child classes.\n",
    "* **Extensibility:** You can add new features to the child class without modifying the parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Engineering Analogy: The Television\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Parent Class (Old TV):** Has basic features like `turn_on()`, `change_channel()`, and `volume_up()`.\n",
    "* **Child Class (Smart TV):** Inherits all basic features from the Old TV but adds new ones like `connect_to_wifi()` and `stream_netflix()`. You don't need to reinvent the \"volume\" logic; you just borrow it.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Syntax: Creating a Child Class\n",
    "\n",
    "To inherit from another class in Python, you simply pass the Parent Class name in parentheses when defining the Child Class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class ParentClass:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class ChildClass(ParentClass):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Scenario: Rectangle to Cuboid\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Rectangle** has length and breadth. A **Cuboid** is just a rectangle extended into 3D space with an added height. Therefore, `Cuboid` should inherit from `Rectangle`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. The \"Missing Link\": `super()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The transcript highlights a critical error: **AttributeError: 'Cuboid' object has no attribute 'length'**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why did this happen?\n",
    "\n",
    "When you define a custom `__init__` method in the Child class (`Cuboid`), it **overrides** (replaces) the Parent's `__init__` method. The Parent's initialization code never runs, so `self.length` and `self.breadth` are never created!\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "You must explicitly call the Parent's constructor using the `super()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Rectangle:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, length, breadth):\n",
    "        self.length = length\n",
    "        self.breadth = breadth\n",
    "\n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        return self.length * self.breadth\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cuboid(Rectangle):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, length, breadth, height):\n",
    "        # 1. Call the Parent's constructor using super()\n",
    "        # This initializes 'length' and 'breadth' inside the Rectangle logic\n",
    "        super().__init__(length, breadth)\n",
    "        \n",
    "        # 2. Initialize the new property specific to Cuboid\n",
    "        self.height = height\n",
    "\n",
    "    def volume(self):\n",
    "        # We can access 'length' and 'breadth' because super().__init__ created them\n",
    "        return self.length * self.breadth * self.height\n",
    "\n",
    "# --- Usage ---\n",
    "c = Cuboid(10, 5, 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Access Parent's method\n",
    "print(f\"Base Area: {c.area()}\")   # Output: 50\n",
    "\n",
    "# Access Child's method\n",
    "print(f\"Volume: {c.volume()}\")    # Output: 150\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Inheritance Syntax:** `class Child(Parent):`\n",
    "2. **Overriding `__init__`:** If you write an `__init__` in the child, you must call `super().__init__()` to ensure the parent initializes its part of the object.\n",
    "3. **`super()`:** A built-in function that returns a temporary object of the parent class, allowing you to call its methods."

    "# Constructors in Inheritance (`super()`)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous module, we established that a Child class inherits attributes and methods from a Parent class. However, a critical issue arises when the Child class defines its own `__init__` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, **defining a method in the Child class with the same name as the Parent class \"overrides\" it.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This means if `Cuboid` defines `__init__`, the `Rectangle`'s `__init__` is **ignored**. Consequently, the `length` and `breadth` attributes are never initialized, leading to an `AttributeError`. To fix this, we must explicitly chain the constructors using `super()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. The Problem: Constructor Overriding\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike languages like Java or C++, Python **does not** automatically call the Parent's constructor if the Child overrides it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Broken Code\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Rectangle:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, length, breadth):\n",
    "        self.length = length\n",
    "        self.breadth = breadth\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cuboid(Rectangle):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, height):\n",
    "        # ⚠️ PROBLEM: This completely replaces Rectangle's __init__\n",
    "        # self.length and self.breadth are NEVER created!\n",
    "        self.height = height\n",
    "\n",
    "# c = Cuboid(10) # Crashes when accessing c.length\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. The Solution: The `super()` Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The `super()` function provides a reference to the Parent class (Superclass). It allows the Child to call methods from the Parent that it has overridden.\n",
    "\n",
    "By calling `super().__init__()`, we force the Parent to run its initialization logic, ensuring all inherited attributes are created correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Logic Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input:** Pass all required arguments (`length`, `breadth`, `height`) to the Child.\n",
    "2. **Delegate:** The Child passes the relevant arguments (`length`, `breadth`) up to the Parent via `super()`.\n",
    "3. **Initialize Local:** The Child initializes its specific arguments (`height`).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Engineering Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the corrected code for the `Cuboid` class inheriting from `Rectangle`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Rectangle:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, length, breadth):\n",
    "        print(f\"Rectangle Init: Initializing {length}x{breadth}\")\n",
    "        self.length = length\n",
    "        self.breadth = breadth\n",
    "\n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        return self.length * self.breadth\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cuboid(Rectangle):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, length, breadth, height):\n",
    "        # 1. Delegate basic initialization to the Parent\n",
    "        # We pass 'length' and 'breadth' up the chain\n",
    "        super().__init__(length, breadth)\n",
    "        \n",
    "        # 2. Initialize the specific property for this class\n",
    "        self.height = height\n",
    "        print(f\"Cuboid Init: Initializing height {height}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    def volume(self):\n",
    "        # We can access length/breadth because super() created them\n",
    "        return self.length * self.breadth * self.height\n",
    "\n",
    "# --- Usage ---\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating the object triggers the chain of constructors\n",
    "c = Cuboid(10, 5, 3)\n",
    "# Output:\n",
    "# Rectangle Init: Initializing 10x5\n",
    "# Cuboid Init: Initializing height 3\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"Volume: {c.volume()}\") # Output: 150\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why not just set `self.length = length` in Cuboid?\n",
    "\n",
    "You *could* technically write `self.length = length` inside `Cuboid` and it would work. However, this is **Bad Practice (Anti-Pattern)** because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Code Duplication:** You are rewriting logic that already exists in `Rectangle`.\n",
    "2. **Maintenance Nightmare:** If `Rectangle` changes its logic (e.g., adds validation to `length`), `Cuboid` won't get that update automatically.\n",
    "3. **Violation of Inheritance:** The point of inheritance is to *reuse* the parent's logic, not copy-paste it.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Overriding:** Defining `__init__` in a Child class stops the Parent `__init__` from running.\n",
    "* **`super()`:** The standard tool to access Parent methods.\n",
    "* **Best Practice:** Always call `super().__init__(args)` at the start of your Child's constructor to ensure the base state is set up correctly."
