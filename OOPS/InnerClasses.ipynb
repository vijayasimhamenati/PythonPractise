If a specific class (e.g., `Engine`) is useful *only* to one other class (e.g., `Car`), it makes sense to define `Engine` inside `Car`. This keeps the code logically grouped and hides the inner class from the rest of the program, preventing clutter.\n","\n","## 1. The Structure\n","\n","The structure is hierarchical. The **Outer Class** acts as a container. The **Inner Class** is defined within the indentation block of the Outer Class.\n","\n","### Key Rules\n","\n","1. **Indentation:** The Inner class must be indented inside the Outer class.\n","2. **Instantiation:** The Outer class typically creates an instance of the Inner class inside its `__init__` constructor.\n","3. **Access:** The Outer class accesses the Inner class's methods through this instance.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 2. Code Implementation\n","\n","Here is the implementation based on the lecture, showing how an Outer class can manage an Inner class object.\n","\n","```python\n","class Outer:\n","    \"\"\"The Enclosing Class\"\"\"\n","    \n","    def __init__(self):\n","        # The Outer class creates an instance of the Inner class\n","        # Note: We access it as 'self.Inner()' because it is a member of the class\n","        self.inner_object = self.Inner()\n","\n","    def show(self):\n","        \"\"\"\n","        Method of Outer class that delegates work to the Inner class.\n","        \"\"\"\n","        print(\"Outer class calling Inner class...\")\n","        # calling the inner object's method\n","        self.inner_object.display()\n","\n","    # --- Nested Class Definition Starts Here ---\n","    class Inner:\n","        \"\"\"The Nested Class\"\"\"\n","        \n","        def __init__(self):\n","            self.inner_data = \"Inner Data\"\n","\n","        def display(self):\n","            print(f\"Data from Inner Class: {self.inner_data}\")\n","    # --- Nested Class Definition Ends Here ---\n","\n","# --- Usage ---\n","\n","# 1. Create the Outer object\n","# This automatically triggers the creation of the Inner object inside __init__\n","out = Outer()\n","\n","# 2. Call the Outer method\n","out.show()\n","\n","```\n","\n","**Output:**\n","\n","```text\n","Outer class calling Inner class...\n","Data from Inner Class: Inner Data\n","\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 3. Execution Flow\n","\n","1. **`out = Outer()`**: You create an instance of the Outer class.\n","2. **`Outer.__init__` runs**: Inside this method, the line `self.inner_object = self.Inner()` executes.\n","3. **`Inner.__init__` runs**: A new Inner object is created, setting `self.inner_data` to \"Inner Data\". This object is stored in `out.inner_object`.\n","4. **`out.show()`**: You call the public method of the Outer class.\n","5. **Delegation**: The `show` method accesses `self.inner_object` and calls `.display()`, which prints the data.\n","\n","### Why do this?\n","\n","This pattern is heavily used in complex data structures or frameworks where an object is composed of smaller, specialized parts (Composition) that shouldn't be exposed globally. For example, a `Human` class might have a nested `Brain` class—you wouldn't need a `Brain` object floating around without a `Human` to contain it."]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"QbW_gQV1-ToG"},"id":"QbW_gQV1-ToG","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.11"},"colab":{"provenance":[]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
