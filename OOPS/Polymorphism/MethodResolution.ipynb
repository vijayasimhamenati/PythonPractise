    "# Method Resolution Order (MRO) in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "**Role:** Senior Python Engineer\n",
    "**Context:** Object-Oriented Programming (Inheritance & Polymorphism)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**Method Resolution Order (MRO)** is the defined rule set that Python follows to determine which method to call when a method is invoked on an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because Python supports **Multiple Inheritance** (a class inheriting from more than one parent), it needs a strict algorithm to decide where to look for a method first. If it didn't have this, it wouldn't know which parent class to prioritize if two parents had the same method name.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to View MRO\n",
    "\n",
    "You can inspect the MRO of any class programmatically using the `.mro()` method or the `__mro__` attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(ChildClass.mro())\n",
    "# Output: [<class '__main__.Child'>, <class '__main__.Parent'>, <class 'object'>]\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. The Hierarchy of `object`\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python 3, **every** class implicitly inherits from the built-in `object` base class. If you don't specify a parent, Python assigns `object` automatically. This is why `object` always appears at the very end of an MRO list.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Inheritance Scenarios & MRO\n",
    "\n",
    "### A. Single Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structure:** Child inherits from Parent.\n",
    "**Rule:** Look in Child → Parent → Object.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Parent:\n",
    "    def show(self): print(\"Parent\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Child(Parent):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "# MRO: Child -> Parent -> object\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Multi-Level Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structure:** GrandChild inherits from Child, which inherits from Parent.\n",
    "**Rule:** Climb the ladder directly up.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Order:** `GrandChild` → `Child` → `Parent` → `object`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Multiple Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structure:** Child inherits from two distinct parents: `class Child(A, B)`.\n",
    "**Rule:** Left-to-Right. Python looks at the first parent listed in the parentheses, then the second.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class A:\n",
    "    def show(self): print(\"A\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class B:\n",
    "    def show(self): print(\"B\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Child(A, B):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "# MRO: Child -> A -> B -> object\n",
    "# Because we defined it as Child(A, B), A comes first.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. The \"Diamond Problem\" (Hybrid Inheritance)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the complex scenario mentioned in the lecture where multiple paths lead back to a common ancestor.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structure:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `B` inherits from `A`.\n",
    "* `Y` inherits from `X`.\n",
    "* Both `A` and `X` inherit from a common top parent `P`.\n",
    "* `C` inherits from both `B` and `Y`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The C3 Linearization Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses the **C3 Linearization** algorithm to solve this. The golden rule of C3 is:\n",
    "**\"Children before Parents, Left before Right.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, it ensures that a parent class (`P`) is never checked until **all** of its children (`A` and `X`) have been checked.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Flow for Class C:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Check C** (The instance itself).\n",
    "2. **Check B** (Left parent).\n",
    "3. **Check A** (Parent of B).\n",
    "4. **Check Y** (Right parent).\n",
    "5. **Check X** (Parent of Y).\n",
    "6. **Check P** (The common grandparent).\n",
    "7. **Check object**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why doesn't it go A -> P immediately?**\n",
    "Because `P` is also a parent of `X`. If Python visited `P` before `X`, it would violate the rule that \"children (`X`) must be checked before parents (`P`).\" Therefore, it pauses the left branch at `A` and switches to the right branch to finish `Y` and `X` before finally visiting `P`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "| Inheritance Type | MRO Rule |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| **Single** | Child → Parent |\n",
    "| **Multiple** | Left Parent → Right Parent |\n",
    "| **Diamond/Hybrid** | Child → Left Branch (Children only) → Right Branch (Children only) → Common Parent |"
