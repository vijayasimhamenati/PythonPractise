    "# Polymorphism: Operator Overloading\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**Operator Overloading** is a specific type of polymorphism where different operators (like `+`, `-`, `*`) have different implementations depending on their operands (the arguments).\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, operators are actually method calls in disguise. When you write `a + b`, Python interprets this as `a.__add__(b)`. By defining these special methods in your own classes, you can enable standard mathematical operators to work with custom objects, making your code more intuitive and expressive.\n",

    "## 1. The \"Magic\" Behind Operators (Dunder Methods)\n",
    "\n",
    "Python reserves special method names that start and end with double underscores (`__`). These are often called **Dunder Methods** or **Magic Methods**. They map operator symbols to class behaviors.\n",

    "| Operator | Magic Method | Expression | Internal Translation |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| **Addition** | `__add__` | `x + y` | `x.__add__(y)` |\n",
    "| **Subtraction** | `__sub__` | `x - y` | `x.__sub__(y)` |\n",
    "| **Multiplication** | `__mul__` | `x * y` | `x.__mul__(y)` |\n",
    "| **Division** | `__truediv__` | `x / y` | `x.__truediv__(y)` |\n",
    "| **Equality** | `__eq__` | `x == y` | `x.__eq__(y)` |\n",
    "| **Less Than** | `__lt__` | `x < y` | `x.__lt__(y)` |\n",
    "| **Print/String** | `__str__` | `str(x)` | `x.__str__()` |\n",

    "\n",
    "Python does not have a built-in geometric vector class. If we try to add two custom objects without overloading `+`, Python will raise a `TypeError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a robust implementation of a 2D Vector class that supports addition, scalar multiplication, equality checks, and readable printing.\n",

    "## 4. Advanced Nuance: Handling Different Types\n",
    "\n",
    "When overloading operators, you must handle cases where the operand types don't match.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Type Checking:** Use `isinstance()` to ensure you are operating on compatible types.\n",
    "2. **`NotImplemented`:** If your method doesn't know how to handle the type passed to it, return `NotImplemented`. This tells Python to try the **Reverse Method** on the other object (e.g., if `a + b` fails, Python tries `b.__radd__(a)`).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def __add__(self, other):\n",
    "    if isinstance(other, Vector):\n",
    "        return Vector(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)\n",
    "    # If user tries: Vector(1,1) + \"Hello\", we can't handle it.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Polymorphism:** Operator overloading allows standard operators (`+`, `-`, `*`) to behave polymorphically based on the objects involved.\n",
    "* **Mechanism:** It works by implementing specific Dunder methods (`__add__`, `__sub__`, etc.).\n",
    "* **Best Practice:** Always implement `__str__` for readability and ensure your operator logic handles type mismatches gracefully."
