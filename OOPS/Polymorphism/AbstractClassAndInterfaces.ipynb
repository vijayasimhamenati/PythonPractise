    "# Writing Abstract Classes in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "An **Abstract Class** serves as a blueprint for other classes. It allows you to create a strict template that enforces what methods a child class *must* implement, while also optionally providing some common functionality (concrete methods) that children can reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we use the built-in `abc` (Abstract Base Classes) module to achieve this.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Abstract Class:** Contains a mix of concrete methods (with code) and abstract methods (empty).\n",
    "* **Interface:** A class where **all** methods are abstract. In Python, this is just a specific type of abstract class.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. The Recipe for Abstract Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "To define an abstract class in Python, you must follow three mandatory steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Inherit from `ABC`:** Your parent class must inherit from the `ABC` class (helper class from the `abc` module).\n",
    "2. **Import the Tools:** You need to import `ABC` and `abstractmethod` from the `abc` module.\n",
    "3. **Use the Decorator:** Mark any method you want to enforce as mandatory with `@abstractmethod`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "class Parent(ABC):  # Step 1: Inherit from ABC\n",
    "    \n",
    "    @abstractmethod  # Step 2: Use the decorator\n",
    "    def method_name(self):\n",
    "        pass  # No body, just 'pass'\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Example: Abstract Class (Mix of Methods)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most common use case. The parent provides some shared logic (`show_id`) but forces the child to define the specific logic (`calculate_area`).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Define the Abstract Parent\n",
    "class Shape(ABC):\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.id = 101\n",
    "\n",
    "    # CONCRETE METHOD: Common logic inherited by all children\n",
    "    def show_id(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"Shape ID: {self.id}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    # ABSTRACT METHOD: No logic here. Children MUST override this.\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def calculate_area(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Define a Child Class\n",
    "class Rectangle(Shape):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, length, breadth):\n",
    "        super().__init__()\n",
    "        self.length = length\n",
    "        self.breadth = breadth\n",
    "\n",
    "    # MANDATORY: We must implement calculate_area\n",
    "    def calculate_area(self):\n",
    "        return self.length * self.breadth\n",
    "\n",
    "# --- Usage ---\n",
    "r = Rectangle(10, 5)\n",
    "r.show_id()              # Calls Parent's concrete method\n",
    "print(r.calculate_area()) # Calls Child's implemented method\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### What happens if you don't override?\n",
    "\n",
    "If `Rectangle` failed to implement `calculate_area`, Python would raise a `TypeError` the moment you tried to create an object:\n",
    "\n",
    "> `TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class Rectangle with abstract methods calculate_area`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Example: Interface (Pure Abstract)\n",
    "\n",
    "An interface is simply an abstract class where **every** method is abstract. It acts purely as a contract, guaranteeing that any child class will have a specific set of behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "class IDatabaseOperations(ABC):\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def connect(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def disconnect(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "# Child class implementing the interface\n",
    "class MySQLDatabase(IDatabaseOperations):\n",
    "    def connect(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Connecting to MySQL...\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    def disconnect(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Disconnecting from MySQL...\")\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | Concrete Class | Abstract Class |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| **Inheritance** | Inherits from standard classes (or `object`). | Must inherit from `ABC`. |\n",
    "| **Instantiation** | Can create objects (`obj = Class()`). | **Cannot** create objects. |\n",
    "| **Methods** | All methods have bodies. | Can have a mix of `@abstractmethod` and normal methods. |\n",
    "| **Child Class Duty** | Optional to override methods. | **Mandatory** to override all abstract methods. |"
