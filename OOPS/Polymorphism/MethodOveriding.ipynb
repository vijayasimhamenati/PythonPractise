    "# Polymorphism: Method Overriding\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**Method Overriding** is a feature of Object-Oriented Programming that allows a Child class (Subclass) to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its Parent class (Superclass).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a key mechanism for achieving **Polymorphism**: the method name remains the same, but the behavior changes depending on whether it is called on a Parent object or a Child object.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. The Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "When a Child class inherits from a Parent class, it gains access to all the Parent's methods. However, sometimes the Parent's implementation does not fit the Child's specific needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Inheritance (Default):** The Child uses the Parent's method as-is.\n",
    "* **Overriding:** The Child re-defines the method with the **same name** and **same parameters**. The Child's version \"shadows\" (replaces) the Parent's version for instances of the Child.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario A: Default Inheritance (No Overriding)\n",
    "\n",
    "If the Child class does not define the method, Python looks up the inheritance chain and finds it in the Parent.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Parent:\n",
    "    def show(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Parent Class: Show Method\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Child(Parent):\n",
    "    pass  # Inherits everything, adds nothing\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "c = Child()\n",
    "c.show() \n",
    "# Output: Parent Class: Show Method\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario B: Method Overriding\n",
    "\n",
    "If the Child class defines a method with the exact same name, Python executes the Child's version. The Parent's version is ignored for that object.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Parent:\n",
    "    def show(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Parent Class: Show Method\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Child(Parent):\n",
    "    # Overriding the 'show' method\n",
    "    def show(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Child Class: Show Method\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "c = Child()\n",
    "c.show() \n",
    "# Output: Child Class: Show Method\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Extending Behavior with `super()`\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, you don't want to completely *replace* the Parent's logic; you want to *extend* it. You can call the Parent's method from within the Child's overridden method using `super()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Parent:\n",
    "    def show(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Displaying Basic Details...\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Child(Parent):\n",
    "    def show(self):\n",
    "        # 1. Call the Parent's version first\n",
    "        super().show()\n",
    "        \n",
    "        # 2. Add Child-specific logic\n",
    "        print(\"Displaying Extra Child Details...\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "c = Child()\n",
    "c.show()\n",
    "# Output:\n",
    "# Displaying Basic Details...\n",
    "# Displaying Extra Child Details...\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Common Pitfall: `super()` on Instances\n",
    "\n",
    "A common mistake is attempting to access `super()` from outside the class (i.e., on the object instance itself).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Invalid Syntax:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "c = Child()\n",
    "\n",
    "# ERROR: 'super' is not an attribute of the object instance\n",
    "# c.super().show() \n",
    "# Raises: AttributeError: 'Child' object has no attribute 'super'\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct Usage:**\n",
    "`super()` is designed to be used **inside** the class definition (specifically inside methods) to refer to the superclass proxy.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",

    "| Feature | Description |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| **Method Overloading** | Same method name, different parameters (Not natively supported in Python). |\n",
    "| **Method Overriding** | Same method name, same parameters, defined in a Child class to replace Parent behavior. |\n",
    "| **`super()`** | Used inside a Child method to call the Parent method of the same name. |\n",
    "| **Polymorphism** | The ability to treat `Child` and `Parent` objects uniformly (calling `.show()`), while getting specific behaviors for each. |"
