    "# Generalization and Specialization in OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), inheritance isn't just about saving a few lines of code. It serves two distinct architectural purposes: **Specialization** and **Generalization**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the difference helps you decide *why* you are creating a child class: are you adding features to an existing object, or are you creating a common standard for a group of objects?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Specialization (The \"Bottom-Up\" Approach)\n",
    "\n",
    "Specialization is the process of taking an existing, functioning class (Parent) and creating a more specific version of it (Child) by adding new features or behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Goal:** Code Reusability and Extension.\n",
    "* **Mechanism:** The Child borrows **all** features from the Parent and adds extra ones.\n",
    "* **Relationship:** The Child \"is a\" Parent, but with superpowers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "| Domain | Parent Class (General) | Child Class (Specialized) | Added Features |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| **Math** | `Rectangle` | `Cuboid` | Adds `height` and `volume()`. |\n",
    "| **Electronics** | `CRT TV` | `Smart TV` | Adds `WiFi`, `Netflix`, `HDMI`. |\n",
    "| **Automotive** | `Basic Car` | `Luxury Car` | Adds `Sunroof`, `Cruise Control`. |\n",
    "\n",
    "### In Python\n",
    "\n",
    "When you write a `Cuboid` class that inherits from `Rectangle`, you are performing **Specialization**. You reuse the logic for `length` and `breadth`, but you *specialize* the class to handle 3D space.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Generalization (The \"Top-Down\" Approach)\n",
    "\n",
    "Generalization is the process of identifying common features among different distinct classes and extracting them into a shared Parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Goal:** Polymorphism and Common Interface.\n",
    "* **Mechanism:** The Parent class often doesn't have concrete implementation logic; it just defines *what* the children must do. The Children **override** these methods to provide specific logic.\n",
    "* **Relationship:** The Parent defines the \"Shape\" or \"Template\" of the Children.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Example: Shapes\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have classes for `Rectangle`, `Circle`, and `Triangle`. They all calculate area, but the math is different for each.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify Commonality:** They are all \"Shapes.\" They all have an `area()` and `perimeter()`.\n",
    "2. **Generalize:** Create a parent class `Shape`.\n",
    "3. **Enforce:** The `Shape` class forces every child to have an `area()` method, even if `Shape` itself doesn't know how to calculate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why do this?\n",
    "\n",
    "It allows you to write code that works on a `Shape` without knowing if it's a circle or a rectangle.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Polymorphism in action\n",
    "for shape in shapes_list:\n",
    "    # We don't care if it's a Circle or Rectangle\n",
    "    # We just know it's a Shape, so it MUST have an area()\n",
    "    print(shape.area())\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## 3. Types of Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve these goals, we use three specific types of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A. Concrete Class\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Definition:** A class where every method has a complete implementation (body).\n",
    "* **Purpose:** **Specialization**. You inherit from it to reuse its working code.\n",
    "* **Example:** `Rectangle` (It fully works on its own).\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Abstract Class\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Definition:** A class that contains a mix of **Concrete methods** (implemented) and **Abstract methods** (dummy/empty methods).\n",
    "* **Purpose:** **Partial Generalization**. You inherit to reuse the concrete logic, but you *must* override the abstract methods.\n",
    "* **Example:** `Vehicle`.\n",
    "* *Concrete:* `start_engine()` (Same for all cars).\n",
    "* *Abstract:* `drive()` (Different for Manual vs. Automatic).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Interface (Pure Abstract)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Definition:** A class where **ALL** methods are abstract (dummy). It has no implementation logic at all.\n",
    "* **Purpose:** **Pure Polymorphism**. It acts purely as a contract or template. It forces the child classes to implement specific behaviors.\n",
    "* **Example:** `Shape`. It doesn't know how to calculate area; it just demands that its children do.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary Table\n",
    "\n",
    "| Class Type | Method State | Primary OOP Goal |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| **Concrete** | All Implemented | Reusability (Specialization) |\n",
    "| **Abstract** | Mixed | Partial Reuse + Polymorphism |\n",
    "| **Interface** | All Abstract (Dummy) | Pure Polymorphism (Generalization) |"
