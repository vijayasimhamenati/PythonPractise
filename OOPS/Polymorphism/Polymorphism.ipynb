    "# Polymorphism in Python: Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**Polymorphism** is a core concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) derived from Greek, meaning \"Many Forms\" (*Poly* = Many, *Morphism* = Forms).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of programming, it refers to the ability of a single interface, function, or operator to perform different actions depending on the **type** of data it is interacting with. It allows you to write flexible, reusable code that can handle various object types without needing specific logic for each one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports polymorphism in several ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Operator Overloading:** Operators like `+` behaving differently for numbers vs. strings.\n",
    "2. **Built-in Polymorphism:** Functions like `len()` working on different data structures.\n",
    "3. **User-Defined Polymorphism:** Writing generic functions that work on any object that satisfies a specific behavior (Interface).\n",
    "4. **Duck Typing:** (To be covered in detail in the next module).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Operator Polymorphism (Operator Overloading)\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common example of polymorphism is the `+` operator. Python instinctively knows how to handle addition based on the operands provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Integers/Floats:** Performs mathematical addition.\n",
    "* **Strings:** Performs concatenation.\n",
    "* **Lists:** Performs list merging.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Engineering Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# 1. Mathematical Addition\n",
    "num_1 = 10 + 20\n",
    "num_2 = 10.5 + 2.5\n",
    "print(f\"Integer Add: {num_1}\")  # Output: 30\n",
    "print(f\"Float Add:   {num_2}\")  # Output: 13.0\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. String Concatenation\n",
    "# The '+' operator changes behavior to join characters\n",
    "str_result = \"Hello\" + \" \" + \"World\"\n",
    "print(f\"String Add:  {str_result}\") # Output: Hello World\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. List Merging\n",
    "# The '+' operator changes behavior to join lists\n",
    "list_result = [1, 2] + [3, 4]\n",
    "print(f\"List Add:    {list_result}\") # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Complex Numbers\n",
    "# Real and Imaginary parts are added separately\n",
    "complex_res = (3 + 2j) + (1 + 7j)\n",
    "print(f\"Complex Add: {complex_res}\") # Output: (4+9j)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaway:** The symbol `+` remains the same, but the **underlying action** transforms based on the data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Built-in Function Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's built-in functions are designed to be polymorphic. A prime example is the `len()` function. It does not care if you pass it a list, a set, or a string; as long as the object is a container, `len()` knows how to count it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Defining different data structures\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "my_set = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}\n",
    "my_str = \"Python\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# The same function 'len' handles all of them\n",
    "print(f\"Length of List:   {len(my_list)}\") # Output: 5\n",
    "print(f\"Length of Set:    {len(my_set)}\")  # Output: 5\n",
    "print(f\"Length of String: {len(my_str)}\")  # Output: 6\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. User-Defined Polymorphic Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "You can write your own functions that accept *any* type of object, provided the object supports the operations performed inside the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, we define a function `calculate_sum`. It works on lists, tuples, and sets because all these types support iteration (`for` loop) and addition (`+`).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def calculate_sum(sequence):\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    A polymorphic function that sums elements of ANY sequence \n",
    "    containing numbers (List, Tuple, Set).\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    total = 0\n",
    "    for element in sequence:\n",
    "        total += element\n",
    "    return total\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Passing a List\n",
    "data_list = [10, 20, 30]\n",
    "print(f\"Sum of List:  {calculate_sum(data_list)}\") # Output: 60\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Passing a Tuple\n",
    "data_tuple = (10, 20, 30)\n",
    "print(f\"Sum of Tuple: {calculate_sum(data_tuple)}\") # Output: 60\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Passing a Set\n",
    "data_set = {10, 20, 30}\n",
    "print(f\"Sum of Set:   {calculate_sum(data_set)}\")   # Output: 60\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this matters\n",
    "\n",
    "This is **Method Overloading** in concept (one function name handling different types). In static languages (like Java/C++), you might need to write `sumInt(int[] arr)` and `sumFloat(float[] arr)`. In Python, one polymorphic function handles all compatible types.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Upcoming Topics\n",
    "\n",
    "This lecture introduced the *concept* of polymorphism. In the following modules, we will dive deeper into the specific mechanisms Python uses to implement this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Duck Typing:** \"If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck.\"\n",
    "2. **Method Overriding:** A child class providing a specific implementation of a method already defined in its parent class.\n",
    "3. **Operator Overloading:** Defining how operators like `+` or `*` work for your *custom* classes."

    "# Polymorphism: Duck Typing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Role:** Senior Python Engineer\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context:** Dynamic Typing & Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**Duck Typing** is a concept related to **Dynamic Typing**, where the *type* or *class* of an object is less important than the *methods* it defines. When you use duck typing, you do not check types at all. Instead, you check for the presence of a given method or attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python terms: If an object has a `talk()` method and a `walk()` method, we treat it like a \"Duck,\" regardless of whether it actually inherits from a `Duck` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. The Mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "In statically typed languages (like Java), a function must explicitly declare the type of object it accepts (e.g., `void move(Duck d)`). If you pass a `Dog` object, the code won't compile, even if `Dog` has the exact same methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the function simply asks: *\"Do you have a `walk` method?\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "* If **Yes**: It runs.\n",
    "* If **No**: It raises an `AttributeError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Engineering Example: Pet Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "We create two completely independent classes (`Duck` and `Dog`). They do **not** share a parent class. However, they share a **common interface** (methods with the same names).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "    def talk(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Quack! Quack!\")\n",

    "# The Polymorphic Function\n",

    "    print(f\"--- Performing tricks with {type(pet).__name__} ---\")\n",
    "    pet.talk()\n",

    "# The same function handles different objects seamlessly\n",

    "## 2. Handling Missing Attributes (`hasattr`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Python doesn't enforce strict interfaces, you might pass an object that *doesn't* have the required method. This would crash the program with an `AttributeError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make Duck Typing robust, we use `hasattr()` to check for capabilities before calling them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Engineering Example: Safe Execution\n",
