The Concept: Loop Inside a Loop\n","\n","A **nested loop** is simply a loop that is placed inside the body of another loop.\n","\n","* **Outer Loop:** The first loop that starts the process.\n","* **Inner Loop:** The loop that runs **completely** for *each single iteration* of the outer loop.\n","\n","**Real-world Analogy:**\n","Think of a clock.\n","\n","* The **Minute Hand** (Inner Loop) must go all the way around (60 steps) for the **Hour Hand** (Outer Loop) to move just once.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 2. Syntax and Execution Flow\n","\n","The syntax is straightforward indentation. The inner loop is indented inside the outer loop.\n","\n","```python\n","# Outer Loop (Runs 3 times: i = 0, 1, 2)\n","for i in range(3):\n","    print(f\"Outer Loop i = {i}\")\n","    \n","    # Inner Loop (Runs 2 times for EACH 'i')\n","    for j in range(2):\n","        print(f\"    Inner Loop j = {j}\")\n","\n","# Output:\n","# Outer Loop i = 0\n","#     Inner Loop j = 0\n","#     Inner Loop j = 1\n","# Outer Loop i = 1\n","#     Inner Loop j = 0\n","#     Inner Loop j = 1\n","# ...\n","\n","```\n","\n","**Key Takeaway:**\n","If the outer loop runs  times and the inner loop runs  times, the code inside the inner loop runs  times.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 3. Practical Use Case: Matrices (2D Arrays)\n","\n","Nested loops are most commonly used to work with grids, tables, or matrices (lists of lists).\n","\n","```python\n","matrix = [\n","    [1, 2, 3],\n","    [4, 5, 6],\n","    [7, 8, 9]\n","]\n","\n","# 1. Iterate through rows\n","for row in matrix:\n","    # 2. Iterate through columns (items in that row)\n","    for num in row:\n","        print(num, end=\" \")\n","    print() # Newline after finishing a row\n","\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 4. Dependent Inner Loops\n","\n","Sometimes, the range of the inner loop depends on the current value of the outer loop. This is classic for creating patterns.\n","\n","**Example: Printing a Triangle**\n","\n","```python\n","# Rows\n","for i in range(1, 6):\n","    # Columns depend on the row number 'i'\n","    for j in range(i):\n","        print(\"*\", end=\"\")\n","    print()\n","\n","# Output:\n","# *\n","# **\n","# ***\n","# ****\n","# *****\n","\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 5. Loop Control in Nested Loops (`break` and `continue`)\n","\n","This is where it gets tricky.\n","\n","* **`break` inside the Inner Loop:** Only stops the **inner** loop. The outer loop continues to the next iteration.\n","* **`break` inside the Outer Loop:** Stops the entire process.\n","\n","```python\n","for i in range(3):\n","    print(f\"Start Outer {i}\")\n","    for j in range(3):\n","        if j == 1:\n","            print(\"  BREAK Inner!\")\n","            break # Stops inner loop, goes back to 'Start Outer'\n","        print(f\"  Inner {j}\")\n","\n","# Output:\n","# Start Outer 0\n","#   Inner 0\n","#   BREAK Inner!\n","# Start Outer 1\n","# ...\n","\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 6. Time Complexity Warning ()\n","\n","Nested loops can be slow.\n","\n","* **1 Loop:** Linear Time . If list has 1000 items, it runs 1000 times.\n","* **2 Nested Loops:** Quadratic Time . If list has 1000 items, it runs **1,000,000** times.\n","* **3 Nested Loops:** Cubic Time . 1,000,000,000 times.\n","\n","**Optimization Tip:**\n","Avoid triply nested loops (`for i... for j... for k...`) unless absolutely necessary.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 7. List Comprehensions with Nested Loops\n","\n","You can flatten a matrix into a single list using a nested comprehension.\n","\n","**Syntax:** `[expression for outer in iterable for inner in iterable]`\n","\n","```python\n","matrix = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]\n","\n","# Standard Way\n","flat = []\n","for row in matrix:\n","    for num in row:\n","        flat.append(num)\n","\n","# Comprehension Way (Read it left to right)\n","flat = [num for row in matrix for num in row]\n","print(flat) # [1, 2, 3, 4]\n","\n","```\n"],"metadata":{"id":"_iN8AcHftxVk"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"RE_7IXf6t4Cd","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1770729748537,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":7,"user":{"displayName":"Vijaya Simha Reddy","userId":"02025652348724397650"}}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"R7xGNTKbt5V2","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1770729748541,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1,"user":{"displayName":"Vijaya Simha Reddy","userId":"02025652348724397650"}}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"ScTRf1Xvt5i4"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### 8. Practice: Pattern Printing with Nested Loops\n","\n","Pattern printing is the best way to master nested loops.
