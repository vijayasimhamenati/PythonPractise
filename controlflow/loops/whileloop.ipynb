The `while` Loop: Basics\n","\n","The `while` loop repeatedly executes a block of code **as long as a condition is true**. It is often called a \"pre-test\" loop because it checks the condition *before* executing the code.\n","\n","**Syntax:**\n","\n","```python\n","while condition:\n","    # Code to execute\n","    # Update the condition variable (Crucial step!)\n","\n","```\n","\n","**Example:**\n","\n","```python\n","count = 0\n","\n","while count < 3:\n","    print(f\"Count is {count}\")\n","    count += 1  # Increment to eventually stop the loop\n","    \n","# Output:\n","# Count is 0\n","# Count is 1\n","# Count is 2\n","\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 2. The Danger Zone: Infinite Loops\n","\n","If the condition never becomes `False`, the loop will run forever (or until your computer crashes/you kill the kernel). This is a common bug.\n","\n","```python\n","# WARNING: Do not run this without a plan to stop it!\n","# while True:\n","#     print(\"This will run forever...\")\n","\n","```\n","\n","> **Jupyter Tip:** If you accidentally trigger an infinite loop, click the **\"Stop\" (Square icon)** button in the Jupyter toolbar to interrupt the kernel.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 3. Loop Control Statements\n","\n","You can alter the flow of a loop using specific keywords.\n","\n","#### A. `break` (The Eject Button)\n","\n","Immediately terminates the loop entirely. It is often used to exit an infinite loop when a specific event happens.\n","\n","```python\n","n = 0\n","while True:  # Infinite loop\n","    print(n)\n","    n += 1\n","    if n >= 3:\n","        break # Exit the loop immediately\n","\n","```\n","\n","#### B. `continue` (The Skip Button)\n","\n","Skips the **rest of the current iteration** and jumps back to the condition check for the next round.\n","\n","```python\n","n = 0\n","while n < 5:\n","    n += 1\n","    if n == 3:\n","        continue # Skip printing for 3\n","    print(n)\n","    \n","# Output: 1, 2, 4, 5 (Notice 3 is missing)\n","\n","```\n","\n","#### C. `pass` (The Placeholder)\n","\n","Does nothing. It is used when a statement is required syntactically but you don't want any command or code to execute.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 4. The `while-else` Block (Unique to Python)\n","\n","Python allows an `else` block to be attached to a loop.\n","\n","* **Logic:** The `else` block runs **only if the loop completes normally** (i.e., the condition became False).\n","* **Exception:** If the loop was stopped by a `break` statement, the `else` block is **skipped**.\n","\n","```python\n","# Scenario 1: Loop finishes naturally\n","n = 0\n","while n < 3:\n","    print(n)\n","    n += 1\n","else:\n","    print(\"Loop finished successfully.\")\n","# Output: 0, 1, 2, Loop finished successfully.\n","\n","# Scenario 2: Loop broken prematurely\n","n = 0\n","while n < 3:\n","    if n == 1:\n","        print(\"Breaking out!\")\n","        break\n","    n += 1\n","else:\n","    print(\"This will NOT print.\")\n","\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 5. Common Pattern: Input Validation\n","\n","`while` loops are perfect for validating user input because you don't know how many times the user will enter invalid data.\n","\n","```python\n","user_input = \"\"\n","\n","# Keep asking UNTIL the input is correct\n","while not user_input.isdigit():\n","    user_input = input(\"Enter a valid number: \")\n","\n","print(f\"Thank you! You entered {user_input}\")\n","\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 6. Emulating `do-while` Loops\n","\n","Python **does not** have a built-in `do-while` loop (which executes code *at least once* before checking the condition).\n","However, we can emulate this behavior using `while True` and `break`.\n","\n","```python\n","# Logic: \"Do this action, THEN check if we should stop\"\n","while True:\n","    password = input(\"Enter password: \")\n","    if password == \"secret123\":\n","        print(\"Access Granted\")\n","        break\n","    else:\n","        print(\"Try Again\")\n","\n","```"],"metadata":{"id":"OGbxGJjZ373q"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["n = 10\n","while n>0 :\n","  print(n)\n","  n=n-1"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"aMPJRn8r4CSz","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1770719265256,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":60,"user":{"displayName":"Vijaya Simha Reddy","userId":"02025652348724397650"}},"outputId":"80d3a2b1-eada-4ce6-9307-0f8e2dcb97f9"},"execution_count":24,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["10\n","9\n","8\n","7\n","6\n","5\n","4\n","3\n","2\n","1\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# # Infinite loop\n","# n = 10\n","# while n>0 :\n","#   print(n)\n","#   n=n+1"],"metadata":{"id":"CXQut74P5HcD","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1770719309385,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":38,"user":{"displayName":"Vijaya Simha Reddy","userId":"02025652348724397650"}}},"execution_count":26,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# printing digits of a number\n","n=1234566667\n","\n","while(n>0) :\n","  print(n%10)\n","  n=n//10\n"],"metadata":{"id":"AoPzLWPl6B0-","executionInfo":{"status":"aborted","timestamp":1770719293439,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":28396,"user":{"displayName":"Vijaya Simha Reddy","userId":"02025652348724397650"}}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# sum of digits of a number\n","n=123\n","sum=0\n","while(n>0) :\n","  sum+=n%10\n","  n=n//10\n","\n","print(sum)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"sAo7g3rR9IZ3","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1770719329380,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":11,"user":{"displayName":"Vijaya Simha Reddy","userId":"02025652348724397650"}},"outputId":"8211408c-a105-4c38-80e8-780cca960324"},"execution_count":27,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["6\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# count digits of a number\n","n=123456789\n","counter =0\n","while(n>0):\n","  counter+=1\n","  n=n//10\n","print(\"no . of digits :\",counter)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"S5q10ucf94OQ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1770719331454,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":8,"user":{"displayName":"Vijaya Simha Reddy","userId":"02025652348724397650"}},"outputId":"36d2e8a5-e139-4326-8d21-81f1a8c47fa3"},"execution_count":28,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["no . of digits : 9\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Reversing a number\n","n=1654\n","r=0\n","\n","while (n>0):\n","  r= r*10+ n%10\n","  n=n//10\n","\n","print('reverse number ',r)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"BGQhfyoN_B46","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1770719333599,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":33,"user":{"displayName":"Vijaya Simha Reddy","userId":"02025652348724397650"}},"outputId":"d5f3f1ad-fa55-457f-d394-bd57bd031ed9"},"execution_count":29,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["reverse number  4561\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["In Python, integers are immutable, meaning their value cannot be changed after they are created.
