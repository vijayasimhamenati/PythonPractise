    "# Variables\n",
    "### 1. What is a Variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a variable is essentially a **name** that refers to a **value** stored in memory. Unlike statically typed languages (like C++ or Java), you do not need to declare the variable type explicitly. Python infers the type at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the `=` operator to assign a value to a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Integer assignment\n",
    "age = 25\n",
    "\n",
    "# String assignment\n",
    "name = \"Alice\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Boolean assignment\n",
    "is_student = True\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Naming Conventions (PEP 8)\n",
    "\n",
    "To write \"Pythonic\" code, follow these rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Snake Case:** Use lowercase words separated by underscores (e.g., `my_variable_name`).\n",
    "* **Case Sensitive:** `Age`, `age`, and `AGE` are three different variables.\n",
    "* **Restricted:** Variable names cannot start with a number and cannot use keywords (like `if`, `for`, `class`).\n",

    "### Variables are References, Not Boxes\n",

    "In many languages, a variable can be thought of as a \"box\" where you store data. In Python, variables are **labels** or **tags** attached to objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Everything is an object:** Numbers, strings, and functions are all objects living in memory.\n",

    "\n",
